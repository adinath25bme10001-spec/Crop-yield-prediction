#       Crop Yield Prediction System
#       works with a simple ML logic



# --------- How it works:--------

 # - You enter your predicted field conditions → get a predicted yield.
 #   
 #   Then enter actual conditions → see how close you were.

# Each row represents one past season's field conditions + final yield.
# These past seasonal field contions are not accurate. 
# consider this as imaginery or sample data only for demostrating and understanding.
